# Genetic Algorithm
# 1. Introduction
Genetic algorithm (GA) is a heuristic search that is based on the idea of natural evolution in order to give the solution to some very complicated problems in reality ranging from Engineering, Economics, and so on. The main part of GA is a process of natural selection where some of individuals in the population are selected for producing their children in next generation.
