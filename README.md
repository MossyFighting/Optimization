# Genetic Algorithm
# 1. Introduction
Genetic algorithm (GA) is a heuristic search that is based on the idea of natural evolution in order to give the solution to some very complicated problems in reality ranging from Engineering, Economics, and so on. The main part of GA is a process of natural selection where some of individuals in the population are selected for producing their children in next generation. 
In general, the GA is deployed when we do not know how the solution looks like. For example, if we want to build a house with some predefined goals such as minimum cost for building, usage of cheap material but still good quality, as much rooms as possible, and so on. Fortnately, the GA will let us know the the best possible house that one will have after going through tremendously all possible aspects of demands but with relatively acceptable time.

# 2. Natural Selection
Natural environment is witnessing a rule in which eventually the strongest one will survive while the weak one will be eliminated. The GA is based on the natural selection uses the same theory to remove the weak ones (e. g., characters, traits, genes, ...) while keep the best solution.
